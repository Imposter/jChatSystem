# jChatSystem

jChatSystem is a TCP network based chat system, using clients and a server. It is a very basic way to communicate using a command line as the interface. It will feature a room-based system and will require client authentication.

## Installation/Usage

NOTE: Make sure you have git, g++, and make installed on your system.

1. Download, or clone repository using `git clone https://github.com/Imposter/jChatSystem/`
2. Use `make [all|clean|install|uninstall]` to complete the desired operation.  
  * `all` - Cleans and then builds the chat server and client
  * `clean` - Cleans the project directories
  * `install` - Installs the chat server and client to the system (TODO!)
  * `uninstall` - Uninstalls the chat server and client from the system (TODO!)
